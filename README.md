# lab2

This dataset represents performance of three student groups. Each group received a different type of automated formative feedback for their programming assignments:

* Group 1: What's wrong
* Group 2: What's wrong + the gap
* Group 3: What's wrong + the gap + hints

Each row represents an individual. There are two columns in the data:

* Group: indicating which group an individual belongs to
* Performance: indicating the performance of an individual
